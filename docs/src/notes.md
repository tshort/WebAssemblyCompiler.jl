# Notes

* WebAssembly's Tuples and Structs cannot be indexed dynamically. Only fixed integer indexing works. So, Tuples are mapped as follows:
  - NTuple -> WebAssembly's Fixed Array
  - Tuple -> WebAssembly's Tuple or Struct. The Struct will GC. WebAssembly's Tuple is more for handling multiple return values. The only option for dynamic indexing is some sort of table lookup.  

* There is no equivalent of stack-allocated Tuples for StaticArrays. There are Fixed Arrays that are heap allocated. Maybe the browser can convert some of those to stack values. [Bumper](https://github.com/MasonProtter/Bumper.jl) could substitute for stack allocation.

* You can't get a pointer from GC heap-allocated arrays. You can't reinterpret or use pointer operations. You can have a buffer and pull in individual values and reinterpret those. That's slow, though.

* Exception handling doesn't work. The compiler doesn't currently handle PhiC nodes or Upsilon nodes in the SSA IR. Binaryen and WebAssembly support try, catch, and throw, so there's no technical reason this can't be supported.

* Similarly error handling isn't attempted. Overlays are used to bypass error code to make things compile.

* The compiler includes some known bandaids and rough spots.

* In `compile_block`, the handling of `QuoteNode`s and `Core.Const` wrappers is uneven. Handling is included in a spotty fashion, but a more consistent approach would be better.

* On the WebAssembly side, on-the-fly type detection doesn't work. Heap objects are not stored with type information. It would be possible to add type info to all types. [Guile Hoot](https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot) does this by adding a type hash to every struct.

* Union's are not supported, and the path to supporting them is unclear. WebAssembly's type system doesn't have anything like that, and it also doesn't allow re-interpeting content easily.

* Several intrinsics are not supported. Some are challenging. `do_apply` / `_apply_iterate` look tough.

* Several of the existing intrinsics only support basic types (Int32, Int64, etc.). Better handling of these would be nice.

* String support is very limited. JavaScript is used to concatenate using `string(...)`. JavaScript uses UTF16 for strings, and Julia's String uses UTF8. WebAssembly supports different string encodings and conversions. Right now, Strings are stored as GC'd UTF8 vectors. These are converted to JavaScript strings on the JavaScript side. No character-level operations are supported. In the future, the [stringref proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/stringref) will improve string interop. String hashing isn't supported, and that's needed for Dicts with Strings.

* Symbols are currently converted straight to strings. That allows basic operations to work, including comparisons. This simple approach may cause issues for some code.

* Binaryen doesn't do any auto-vectorization. WebAssembly has basic SIMD types, but none are supported by WebAssemblyCompiler. 

* LoopVectorization doesn't work. It's LLVM specific.

* Using overlays with `@jscall` of normal Julia code will block constant propagation by the Julia compiler because the Julia compiler can't know what's happening and can't run it in the existing process.  

* WebAssembly doesn't support circular references, but Julia does. What we do is assign a default value for the circular reference and hope it doesn't cause problems. This works for the Observables support because the circular references aren't used after the set of Observables is statically compiled.

* The support of aliased objects may still be patchy. Some were fixed up recently, but I worry that some still lurk (meaning you might get a copy when you want two references to point to the same object).

## Comparing Approaches to Generating WebAssembly

[StaticCompiler](https://github.com/tshort/StaticCompiler.jl) can also generate WebAssembly from Julia code. Some of the advantages of that approach include:
* LLVM generates fast code.
* The package is simple ([GPUCompiler](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUCompiler.jl) and Julia's compiler does all the work).

The main disadvantages of StaticCompiler are:
* No GC built in.
* No clear path to include libjulia capability, so no GC, and everything must be manually allocated ([StaticTools](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StaticTools.jl)).
* No global variables.
* The Julia compiler doesn't make a good cross compiler. For example, indexes into structs sometimes use the host index and sometimes the target index ([discussions](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUCompiler.jl/issues/486#)).

The compiler in this project is better in some ways, including:
* Support for WebAssembly GC (structs, strings, arrays, ...).
* Good interop with JavaScript.
* Can tailor compilation to WebAssembly better.
* Hacking the compiler is easier.

The downsides of this approach are:
* Code isn't as good as LLVM's. The biggest issue may be no autovectorization.
* WebAssembly's type system is limited. This should improve in the future.
  * No nested structs or arrays of structs; nesting boxes everything; use [StructArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StructArrays.jl), [ComponentArrays](https://github.com/jonniedie/ComponentArrays.jl), [ValueShapes](https://github.com/oschulz/ValueShapes.jl), or other Julia packages to organize nested data using flat arrays.
  * All structs are boxed.
* Browser support for WASM-GC is just beginning.
* More bugs.


# Project ideas

## BLAS

Implement replacements for key BLAS functionality. This could be tackled by compiling an existing library to WebAssembly (like [BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis)) or by implementing functionality in Julia.

## Makie

Makie in the browser would be so useful. Plot directly via WebGL or WebGPU.

## Robust Array support

Once the [Memory type PR](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/51319) is merged, update the Array support in WebAssemblyCompiler. Support grow and multidimensional arrays.

## Vectorization / SIMD

WebAssembly supports basic SIMD types. There are several ways that could be incorporated:

* Write a Binaryen pass to do auto-vectorization (C++).
* For loops with `@simd`, vectorize those with Julia. This would be at the typed IR level.
* Add support for WebAssembly's basic SIMD types.

## Implement Int128

Use of Int128's is common in Julia code, but it's not a native WebAssembly type. Add a package to mimic Int128's which can be incorporated using overlays.

## Exception handling

Handle PhiC and Upsilon nodes in the SSA IR. WebAssembly has `throw` and other exception-handling features. This might need the equivalent of relooping but for exceptions.

## Union types

WebAssembly doesn't have this capability, so some mechanism would be needed to mimic these.

## CI / testing

Update [NodeCall](https://github.com/sunoru/NodeCall.jl) to support the latest WebAssembly features, and update tests ([issue](https://github.com/sunoru/NodeCall.jl/issues/14)).

## Convert / test your favorite package

Compiling code using key packages would help improve the code.
